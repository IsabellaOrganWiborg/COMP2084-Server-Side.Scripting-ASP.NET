Gaming Web Application & Database 

Proposal 

    The trending theme/topic for this website is the bases of video game characters. In the world of games there are a lot of key components from item bags, quests, characters, and maps to blocking, attack/block damage, loot drops and health points. Today, millions play video games and with its various loops and variables that are greatly entangled in the development of a game make it an interesting compiling of code to be investigated and learned. The progression of video games popularity is considered in the development of this project and the growth that is forceable for the future of this industry, is why this topic is being pursued.  
    
    Along with the many lists and tables that are built for a video game, there are object-oriented programming principles that are involved in the development. Abstraction and a few functions in encapsulation can be shown in places like the controls of the player allowing control of the actions and movements of one’s character under parameters that outline how those movements are made and are understood. While Inheritance and Polymorphism can be shown in the enemies/NPC’s of the game where actions are following a set path that could even be re-used and unnoticed by the game users.
